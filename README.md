# Market Master for Amazon Alexa
"Market Master" allows you to speak a company's natural name to get their stock price and daily change. No more trying to remember a company's ticker symbol or telling Alexa to "stop" due to a lengthy response!

Built for my own use as well as to compete in [Amazon's Hackster Competition](https://www.hackster.io/nickschwab/market-master-c3a46e)
